Home Budget Planner

A project I am currently working on and which I am very passionate about. I believe it combines both my skills learned in Architecture and Construction field and also my developing skills on IOs development and using Swift.

I believe most of us have struggled through renovating an apartment, setting up a new house or even redecorating a room. Sometimes we even seek professional help to guide us through this. My goal is to make it as easy as possible for everyone to have a possibility to create a new home while getting an estimated cost and not exceeding the set budget limits.
